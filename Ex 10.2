10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the 
messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by 
finding the time and then splitting the string a second time 
using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print 
out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.
